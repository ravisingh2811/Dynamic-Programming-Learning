There are two type of knapsack 
         1. 0-1 kanpsack (that is solve by Dp {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/})
         2. fractional kanpsack(that is solve by Greedy Approach not DP {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/}).
         3. Unbounded Knapsack(Solve by Dp {https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unbounded-knapsack-repetition-items-allowed })
         
 -------------------+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++--------------------------------------------
 In this we are going to discuss 0-1 kanpsack.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Let see the promblem statement of 0-1 knapsack
            Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
            In other words, given two integer vector val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. 
            Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this 
            subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

          Question aries that how can we say that this 0-1 knapsack is DP promblem ??
          So if you remember that there are two condition to identify 
                1. choice -- In this given question there is two choice for every Item, what are those choices , either we include this item in knapsack or not.  
                 2. Optimal -- In the output question asking for max total values.
                       |
             {min , max , largest , smallest etc.}
          
        So, you surly say that is Dp promblem.
